#Here is a guide to make a simple hello-world program

#1) Please put your Name, About You, etc here

Name = "Varun"
Bio = "I am a Data Science Enthusiast. I love to work with Python, R, SAS and Tableau. Have knowledge of Microsot Excel, Power BI also."
Profile = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamvarunm/"

#2) Code starts from here (Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same. Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense)

print("Hello World")

print("My name is", Name)

print(Bio)

print("My Linkedin profile - ", Profile)

print("Thank You for your time.")
